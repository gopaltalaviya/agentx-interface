/**
 * `formatUnits` turns base units into something a person reads, and it is the
 * only place in this repo that touches money.
 *
 * It had no tests. That is the wrong shape for a function whose failure mode
 * is a number on screen that is wrong by a factor of a million — during a
 * demo whose entire claim is that the payments are real.
 *
 * The rule it must never break: **the string is the source of truth.** A
 * uint128 amount exceeds 2^53, so anything that routes through a JS number
 * loses precision silently, and the first symptom is a total that does not
 * reconcile with the chain.
